\begin{theorem}[Odd Prime Property]
For any prime $p > 2$, the number $p$ is odd.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $p > 2$ and $p$ is prime, $p$ is not divisible by 2.
By definition, a number that is not divisible by 2 is odd.
Therefore, $p$ is odd.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Prime Number]
A natural number $n > 1$ is called \emph{prime} if its only positive divisors are 1 and $n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Every integer greater than 1 is either prime or composite.
\end{lemma}
