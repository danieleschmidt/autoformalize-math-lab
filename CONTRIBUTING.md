## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- At least one proof assistant (Lean 4, Isabelle/HOL, or Coq)
- LaTeX distribution (for processing mathematical content)
- API access to an LLM service (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autoformalize-math-lab.git
   cd autoformalize-math-lab
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

6. **Install proof assistants** (choose one or more)
   ```bash
   # Lean 4
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
   
   # Isabelle (download from https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
   # Coq (via package manager or opam)
   ```

7. **Run tests to verify setup**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
