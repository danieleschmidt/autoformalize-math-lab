## Reporting a Vulnerability

The autoformalize-math-lab project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to security@autoformalize-math-lab.org (if available)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the project maintainers directly through encrypted communication

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
- Audit code to find any similar problems
- Prepare fixes for all supported releases
- Release security updates as soon as possible

## Security Considerations for Academic/Research Use

### LLM API Security

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits and potential costs
- **Data Privacy**: Consider that mathematical content sent to LLM APIs may be stored or logged
- **Model Outputs**: LLM-generated proofs should always be verified by proof assistants

### Proof Assistant Security

- **Code Execution**: Proof assistants execute code during verification
- **Trusted Computing Base**: Only run proofs from trusted sources
- **Sandbox Environment**: Consider using containerized environments for untrusted content
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and memory limits for proof checking

### Input Validation

- **LaTeX Processing**: LaTeX files can contain executable code; sanitize inputs
- **PDF Parsing**: PDF files may contain malicious content; use safe parsing libraries
- **File Uploads**: Validate file types and sizes for any upload functionality
- **User Input**: Sanitize mathematical expressions and proof statements

### Data Security

- **Mathematical Content**: Ensure proper attribution and licensing of mathematical content
- **Research Data**: Protect proprietary or unpublished mathematical research
- **Benchmark Datasets**: Respect licensing terms of mathematical benchmark datasets
- **Cache Security**: Formalization caches may contain sensitive mathematical content

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Areas of Focus

1. **LLM Prompt Injection**: Malicious mathematical content could potentially manipulate LLM responses
2. **Proof Assistant Code Execution**: Generated proof code is executed by proof assistants
3. **LaTeX Processing**: LaTeX compilation can execute arbitrary code
4. **Dependency Security**: Monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities
5. **API Security**: Secure handling of LLM API communications

### Mitigation Strategies

- Input sanitization for mathematical content
- Sandboxed execution environments
- Regular dependency updates
- Secure API key management
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Researchers and Academics

- **Verify Generated Proofs**: Always verify LLM-generated proofs with proof assistants
- **Review Mathematical Content**: Manually review important mathematical results
- **Secure Environments**: Use isolated environments for processing untrusted content
- **Data Backup**: Maintain secure backups of important mathematical work

### For Developers and Contributors

- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security-focused review
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities
- **Secret Management**: Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive data
- **Testing**: Include security testing in the development workflow

### For System Administrators

- **Network Security**: Secure network communications to LLM APIs
- **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls for multi-user systems
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system usage and potential security incidents
- **Updates**: Keep systems and dependencies updated with security patches

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to security reports within 48 hours
- We will work with security researchers to understand and address issues
- We will provide credit to researchers who report issues responsibly
- We will maintain transparency about security issues once they are resolved

### What We Ask

- Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruption
- Do not access or modify data that is not your own
- Report issues as soon as possible after discovery

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2)
- Announced through GitHub releases and security advisories
- Documented with clear upgrade instructions
- Backported to supported versions when possible
