# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains documentation and templates for GitHub Actions workflows that should be implemented for this repository.

## Overview

As an autonomous SDLC enhancement, this project requires CI/CD workflows to ensure code quality, security, and deployment automation. The workflows documented here provide a comprehensive foundation for modern software development practices.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Primary continuous integration and deployment pipeline

**Triggers**: 
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Manual dispatch

**Key Steps**:
- Multi-version Python testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Dependency installation and caching
- Code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety)
- Unit and integration testing with coverage
- Mathematical correctness testing
- Build and packaging verification
- Documentation building
- Artifact publishing (on release)

**Required Secrets**:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (for package publishing)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (for coverage reporting)

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis

**Triggers**:
- Daily schedule
- Push to main branch

- Consider using Docker containers for consistent environments

### 4. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)

**Purpose**: Monitor performance and resource usage

**Triggers**:
- Weekly schedule
- Push to main branch (selected tests only)
- Manual dispatch for full suite

**Key Steps**:
- LLM API call performance testing
- Memory usage profiling
- Processing speed benchmarks
- Resource consumption monitoring
- Performance regression detection

### 5. Documentation (`docs.yml`)

**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation

**Triggers**:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests modifying documentation
- Release creation

**Key Steps**:
- Sphinx documentation building
- API documentation generation
- Tutorial validation
- Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Link checking and validation

### 6. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release process

**Triggers**:
- Git tag creation (v*)
- Manual dispatch

**Key Steps**:
- Version validation
- Changelog generation
- Package building and testing
- PyPI publication
- GitHub release creation
- Docker image publishing
- Documentation update

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Implement Primary Workflows

Start with the most critical workflows:

1. **ci.yml** - Primary CI/CD pipeline
2. **security.yml** - Security scanning
3. **docs.yml** - Documentation building

### Step 3: Configure Secrets

In GitHub repository settings, add required secrets:

- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For PyPI package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For code coverage reporting
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For LLM testing (use test account)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude API testing (use test account)

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

Configure GitHub Pages to deploy from the docs workflow:
1. Go to Settings > Pages
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Configure custom domain if needed

### Step 5: Configure Branch Protection

Set up branch protection rules for main branch:
- Require status checks (CI workflow)
- Require pull request reviews
- Require up-to-date branches
- Include administrators in restrictions

## Workflow Templates

### Basic CI Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    # Add remaining steps...
```

### Security Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Security

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run security scan
      # Add security scanning steps...
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Workflow Health Monitoring

1. **Status Badges**: Add workflow status badges to README.md
2. **Notifications**: Configure Slack/email notifications for failures
3. **Metrics**: Track build times and success rates
4. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for security vulnerabilities

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Weekly**: Review failed workflows and address issues
- **Monthly**: Update workflow dependencies and actions
- **Quarterly**: Review and optimize workflow performance
- **Annually**: Audit security configurations and secrets

## Advanced Configurations

### Matrix Testing

Use matrix strategies for comprehensive testing across:
- Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Proof assistant versions (Lean 4.x, Isabelle 2023, etc.)

### Caching Strategies

Implement caching for:
- Python dependencies (`pip cache`)
- Pre-commit environments
- Proof assistant installations
- LLM API response caches (for testing)

### Conditional Execution

Use path-based conditions to optimize workflow execution:
- Run mathematical tests only when `.tex` or `.lean` files change
- Run documentation builds only when `docs/` changes
- Run security scans when dependencies change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Timeout**: Increase timeout for LLM-dependent tests
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper retry logic and rate limiting
3. **Flaky Tests**: Use test retries for mathematical verification tests
4. **Resource Limits**: Optimize memory usage in proof assistant tests

### Debug Strategies

1. **Debug Logging**: Enable debug output for failing workflows
2. **Artifact Collection**: Save logs and intermediate files
3. **Step-by-step Testing**: Break complex workflows into smaller jobs
4. **Local Reproduction**: Use `act` tool for local workflow testing

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Limit secret scope to necessary workflows
- Audit secret access regularly

### Permission Management

- Use minimal required permissions
- Avoid `GITHUB_TOKEN` with write access when possible
- Implement security scanning for workflow files
- Regular review of third-party actions
