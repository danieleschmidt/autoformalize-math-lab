# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock
#poetry.toml

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.
#   https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/project/#working-with-version-control

# pixi
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pixi.lock in version control.
#pixi.lock
#   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
#   in the .venv directory. It is recommended not to include this directory in version control.
