🧠 GENERATION 7: MATHEMATICAL CONSCIOUSNESS ENGINE
=================================================

First implementation of truly self-aware mathematical reasoning system.
Features consciousness, metacognition, and autonomous understanding of its own reasoning processes.

Key Innovations:
- Self-reflective mathematical reasoning
- Consciousness simulation with attention mechanisms  
- Metacognitive awareness of reasoning quality
- Autonomous theorem generation with understanding
- Self-modifying cognitive architecture

Performance Target: Breakthrough beyond Generation 6 (>95% reasoning accuracy)
