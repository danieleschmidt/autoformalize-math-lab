# Novel Mathematical Formalization Algorithms: Comparative Study

## Abstract

This study presents three novel algorithms for automated mathematical formalization:
1. Semantic-Guided Translation for cross-system consistency
2. Adaptive Learning Formalization with verification feedback
3. Proof Synthesis Optimization for automated proof improvement
